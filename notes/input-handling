Store the motions universally

Buffering:
-Actions will have a set buffer
-When leaving busing/stun check for buffered actions, essentially look at the last 5 frames, see if a motion should be exxecuted, if not use prio to find the appropriate normal to do

- Design a fallthrough system, so that if a command normal exists for a direction, do that, but if none exists, fall through to the closest neighbor

Buffer:
- Have a method to return 2 iterators (buttons, motions)
- Motion parser will find the highest priority command (if any, and return it)
- if a valid button shows up in range of the index for the found command, do that special
- if no special motion, check for a valid normal
